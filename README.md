# Playmaker Actions for COZY: Stylized Weather 3
![Cozy PM by Grim](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2be20b5a-693e-49dc-8aa4-060d845e081d)

Hi! I'm Grim. I created these COZY Playmaker actions for a current project and figured I would share them with other COZY users/community members. These are **FREE**. If you see a pack somewhere with these specific scripts, it's not me and don't pay thieves. ;)

If you appreciate any of these, please just follow me on X ([@CopiumGames](https://x.com/copiumgames)) and/or support Distant Lands, the developer of the COZY collection. ([Distant Lands on Unity Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/40676))

*If you need help or want to request changes or additional scripts, DM me on X for now.*

**Future Updates:** It's highly likely I'll be adding, tweaking or updating scripts as needed, or requested. I'll also provide those here.

### For Game Creator 2:

For COZY 3 integration with **Game Creator 2**, I highly recommend Fullscreen's Integration. It's amazing and was a partial inspiration for several of the actions I created here.
